# hello-world
This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow.
My name is Kelli Chaires, a 45 year old woman. I have been married for 24 years, my husband's name is Marco and we have two children. Scott is the oldest, he is 22 and just graduated from UTSA with a major in Psychology and is working toward joining the FBI and become a Profiler. My daughter Erin is 19 and is starting her junior year at UT majoring in Neuroscience and pursuing a career as a Physician. I work at USAA in Insurance as a Dispatcher and my husband works in Construction.
I made a mistake and somehow merged the branches, then I tried to revert the changes and it didn't work so now my bio is in the main branch. 
I am trying this exercise again, hopefull I will get it.
